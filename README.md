# Hello, I'm Justin
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justindwarren/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-0072b1?&style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white" /></a>

Entry-level cybersecurity professional with a strong foundation in threat detection, incident response, risk 
management, and a growing interest in cloud security. I gained hands-on experience through the UT Dallas Cybersecurity 
Bootcamp and earned my CompTIA Security+ certification, developing skills in SIEM tools, log analysis, and red and blue 
team operations. With a background in data analysis and client services, I enjoy working with teams to strengthen security 
and continuously grow my skills. 

## Objective


My journey in tech began with curiosity and, through bootcamp training and Security+ certification, has grown into a passion for IT, cybersecurity, and technology. I’m excited to apply my skills in an entry-level role while continuing to learn and contribute.
